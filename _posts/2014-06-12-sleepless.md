This is a day that is not as tough as I thought it would be when I couldn't fall sleep in the night.

I was sleepness last night, for the whole night. I became worried at 1am, 2am, and kept sending honey text messages for comfort. I gained a bit of peace after 2am, by keeping telling myself that nothing is a big deal because he is always there supporting me. I almost fell asleep twice when some unknown noises suddenly woke me up. I cannot approach sleep any further after that.

It was in fact much tougher yesterday. I woke up early, and stayed in the van for almost 6 hours. When we finally reach Fraueninsel, I was both tired and hungry, and the weather was hot. But we didn't have time for any rest or any food, because we had to rush to the seminar room to start our workshop.

Finally at 5pm, I went with a group of guys to the small bar where they served drinks and cakes. I ordered an ice coffee like anyone else because it was so hot, as well as an Apfel Kuchen. I didn't finish any of them anyway, but I felt so sick later at 6pm, the time of dinner according to the abbey's rule.

I apologized for my leaving without taking any food, and I cried over the phone call to honey. I didn't feel any better until I took a shower, lied in bed for an hour, and finally took some food which was fortunately took back for me by Lucy.

I was therefore supposed to "sleep tight" last night. Unfortunately, it just turned out the opposite way.

After the last message with honey at 4am, I tried to sleep again but found out it was getting brighter outside. And I realized that the sun will come out just in an hour.

I suddenly felt frustrated and angry again, which I knew for sure that it will be never possible to fall asleep with such negative mood. At half past four, I checked the weather forecast, who says the sun will come out at 5:10, and it will be cloudy which means I may probably see the sunrise. I just gave up trying sleep, and decided at once that I will go to see the sunrise today.

5am in the morning. No one was outside except the singing birds and happy ducks. The air was fresh; the temperature was just neither high or low; the view of Chiemsee is so quiet and nice. I didn't feel angry any more.

I looked to the east, and found out the direction where the run would rise.

It jumped out as a heated and dense orange point. And it grew bigger and bigger and I can just notice its movement so evidently. It was amazing despite the thick clouds which made the sun never completely visible. I took many pictures and wondered how nice it would be to spot all this together with honey.

The day turned out to be not as tough as I thought. I caught a chance at 10:30 to sleep for an hour, tightly, and the whole day is just fine.

So what is scary about insomnia?

So what is scary at all? Every bad thing can have side effect, which make double negative a positive.

Besides, I should've be so grateful that I've got a life accompany who is always so supportive.
